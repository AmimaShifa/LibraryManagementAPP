# Problem Statement
Onsite library mangement system is time consuming, inefficient and inaccessible.

# Proposed Solution with screenshots
A library management system is software that is designed to manage all the functions of a library. It helps librarian to maintain the database of new books and the books that are borrowed by members along with their due dates.

This system completely automates all your libraryâ€™s activities. The best way to maintain, organize, and handle countless books systematically is to implement a library management system software.
